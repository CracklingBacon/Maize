# Maize

This here is a text-based self-solving maze!

It was an exercise in stacks for a data structures 
and algorithms course.

It's pretty cool!

When I had finished, I took the liberty of 
animating the text for a much more fun interface.

I also made a "crossplatform.h" header file to 
define common functions differently at compile 
time, depending on if the operating system is 
Windows-based or Unix/Linux-based (POSIX).
